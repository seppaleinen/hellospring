### TODO

* Receive list of objects from http client
* "The following annotation processors were detected on the compile classpath:  
    'io.micronaut.annotation.processing.TypeElementVisitorProcessor' and   
    'io.micronaut.annotation.processing.PackageConfigurationInjectProcessor' and  
    'io.micronaut.annotation.processing.BeanDefinitionInjectProcessor'.   
 Detecting annotation processors on the compile classpath is deprecated and   
 Gradle 5.0 will ignore them. Please add them to the annotation processor path instead.  
  If you did not intend to use annotation processors,   
  you can use the '-proc:none' compiler argument to ignore them."
